Binary search doesn't scan each item in a list. 
It scans items based on the midpoint between the
minimum possible value and the maximum possible
value. 

If a list is small, then using a linear search will
likely be faster, as it will simply check every
item quicker than it takes to divide over.

Linear searches can also be used on unsorted lists whereas a Binary Search cannot.
